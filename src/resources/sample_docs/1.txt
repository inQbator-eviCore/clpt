Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa) infection in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients is associated with worse long-term pulmonary disease and shorter survival, and chronic Pa infection (CPA) is associated with reduced lung function, faster rate of lung decline, increased rates of exacerbations and shorter survival. By using exome sequencing and extreme phenotype design, it was recently shown that isoforms of dynactin 4 (DCTN4) may influence Pa infection in CF, leading to worse respiratory disease.

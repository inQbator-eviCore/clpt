"""A module to store experiment scripts.

`blist-test.py` provides a script to conduct two experiments with three runs in each experiment to compare run time
performance of List and B-List. In the first experiment, one million random floating numbers (between 0 and 1) were
created with List and B-List. In the second experiment, we performed random slices of the List and B-List for 1000
times. Total run times from each of three runs for both experiments are exported."""

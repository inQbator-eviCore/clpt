Briefly, the patient has low back pain radiating into the right hip. The oral steroids prescribed in the office provided some improvement, though the pain remains bothersome. The patient has adjacent segment degeneration at the L2/3 level with a stepwise listhesis there, resulting in foraminal stenosis. We talked about the conservative treatment paradigm, and how I would strongly advocate for a core strengthening regimen particularly where the patient is seated much of the day due to longstanding weakness in the lower extremities. We also discussed the potential benefit of an injection at that L2/3 segment, and where the pain is improved following the course of oral steroids the patient will defer that recommendation for the time being. We discussed the increased weakness in the lower extremities found on exam while in the office, and I do not appreciate a structural spine source for that symptom. I also have a low suspicion it would be due to progressive cervical stenosis where the patient had no other abnormal findings on exam from an upper motor neuron perspective. The patient has not appreciated any significant change in the lower extremity strength since the prior office visit with us in [DATE], as the patient does not attempt weight bearing with the lower extremities. We discussed the concept of an extension of fusion to address the adjacent segment, and is  certainly hoping to avoid that. We talked about re-imaging the cervical spine where she has known stenosis there, to evaluate whether that might need to be addressed prior to a lumbar intervention should the lumbar symptoms progress to be refractory to conservative intervention.

They state approximately 2 years ago was throwing a brick onto a pile and felt a pop their arm on the right side and developed a Popeye deformity consistent with a bicep tendon tear. The patient states previous physician offered to fix this arthroscopically but the patient did not have this done. The patient has had arthroscopic rotator cuff surgeries in each shoulder. The patient does have MRIs of both the left and right shoulder but we do not have the discs or images to review. The report does comment on a full-thickness rotator cuff tear of the supraspinatus on the right with 4 cm of retraction and muscle atrophy as well as complete tear of the long head of the biceps. Rates the pain 6 out of 10. Also has pain that travels down the back of the arm. Denies any neck pain. Does feel weak lifting overhead. No weakness in grip strength. States the patient has been doing home exercises as well as therapy exercises without significant benefit. Oral medicines do not help.  Right shoulder has a grossly normal appearance with slight popeye deformity when contracting the bicep. Rotator cuff strength testing 4/5 supraspinatus minimal infraspinatus weakness but otherwise intact. Contralateral shoulder exam does reveal comparative range of motion but also mild discomfort with supraspinatus testing but no weakness comparative to the right. Previous MRI imaging reports were reviewed a showing a supraspinatus full-thickness tear with 4 cm of retraction and muscle atrophy on the right as well as long head of biceps tendon rupture. X-rays taken in clinic of the right shoulder do show overall preserved alignment to the joint space with excision of distal clavicle from previous surgery as well as some osteophyte arthritis change in the glenohumeral joint.  We discussed treatments going forward. At this point they are significantly limited specifically due to pain and weakness on the right side with a known tear. The MRI is over a year old and he feels his symptoms gotten worse since the MRI. The patient has been working on home exercises and different therapy exercises without significant benefit at this time. We will order a new MRI for further assessment and likely possible surgical planning. The patient likely will need a reverse total shoulder arthroplasty given the previous MRI findings due to the status of his rotator cuff. Does have some mild osteoarthritic changes as well. We offered a cortisone injection for pain but they declined as they would like more definitive treatment. We will call the patient with the MRI results and discuss next steps. The patient would like to proceed. All questions were answered. The patient and the partner stated an understanding and agreed the plan."
